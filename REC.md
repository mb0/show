Recordings
==========

 * 2023-01-22 [Self Help - Cape Cassandra](https://soundcloud.com/djselfhelp/dj-self-help-cape-cassandra)
   First recording after some setup tests. I tried one song and only one take, that was not great.
   I need to find good equalizer, compressor, limiter setup and save that as presets. And this is
   the first session that I want to mix with the video.
   I could sync the video and audio using [Flowblade](https://jliljebl.github.io/flowblade/) and
   also not use a portrait aspect ration (same with [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)). But
   luckily Ardour can be used to sync video and audio. I ended up using Blender to convert the
   result, and plan to try to use it for a/v sync next time.

 * 2023-01-23 I have finally adjusted the input latency of my microphones and have saved yesterdays
   ardour plugin stacks as templates. Today I will run the android scrcpy on a laptop next to the
   camera, luckily I just bought a new mouse to remote control the laptop to remote control the
   smart phone.
   I decided that using only one and the first take is a great theme for this show. Yesterdays
   recordings had some poor taps here and there, some are artefacts of the equalizer raising a ghost
   tap to a audible one, but it was ok for the first take. Todays recordings:

     yt: [full](https://youtu.be/tuZpUrqhtPM)
   * That concludes the second day of recording. I only did one second take for the 4Hero-Jazzanova
     remix. Ardour crashed on me after the 30min Cid Rim recording, but the files were still there,
     so everything worked out fine. I adjusted the plugins and saved presets and templates.
   * I am not sure if I do the video sync and editing today… I am not yet satisfied with the
     recording quality. I want some noise reduction plugin and some filter path. I want the sound
     especially the resonances to be more open, the taps and kicks should be cleaner. I should
     probably wait to meet my best friend, who does that professionally.
   * Reviewing the video recordings, I noticed the smart phone has a better de-noise pass and that
     the camera stabilization seems to follow my body movement and crop the view area for headroom.
   * Total audio dubbed with video recordings today: 2:35:25; second takes: 1 :D

 * 2023-01-24 I have discovered that the naming of Ardour session folder uses a unfortunate format.
   I try to rename them first before recording new sessions.
   * [Nina Simone - Feeling Good](https://youtu.be/oHRNrgDIJfo)

   * [Hooded Youth, ChromeCrowns - Burn Cartel Radio 88](https://soundcloud.com/burncartel/bc-radio-episode-88?in=hoodedyouth/sets/burn-cartel-radio-episode-88)
   * Total recording time 3:09 hours; no second take
   * I adjusted the equalizer and compressor settings for both mics and tried video syncing in
     blender for the first recording and some others.
   * I read and refreshed some about html5 video and audio apis and started preliminary testing

 * 2023-01-25
   * I did video sync and render in blender for the burn cartel recording and learned a bit about
     blender scripting in python. I already configured a project template and learned about relative
     paths in blender.
   * [Love Taps - July 2016 Subdrive Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/subdrive/subdrive-podcast-episode-11-july-2016-love-taps)
     I recorded the first take and it had some stumbles but was ok overall, however something was
     wrong with the mic and it sounds like it had bit-crusher effect all the time. It is gone now.
     It must have been a XLR-Cable under tension. This was an 1-hour mic check ;) and must be
     avoided in the future.

 * 2023-01-26 The last 8 hours I exported, synced, cut, rendered and uploaded videos and clips to
   [my youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@mbnull). After some sleep I do some more.
   * [K-$ADILLA - El Super Spicy Tape](https://soundcloud.com/thunderstone-labs/sst)

   * [Footprint Project - NANA](https://soundcloud.com/lalonova/footprint-project-nana-radio-edit)
     Second take because the mic distortion happend again. This time I identified the culprit: the
     pipewire system can be restarted when mic check reveals distortions.
   * [Knower - Living Room Power Set 2020](https://youtu.be/atBO6e7k5Wo)
     Technically first take, because I forgot to arm the audio recording the first time…

   * I get better and better sound out of these mics by better placement and better equalizer,
     compressor, hilo filter settings.
   * Total recording time 4:16 hours; three improvs, no second take. Tour de force!

   * Total recording time 2:15 hours. Everything was fine!
   * I sorted out my CongaDesk video collage concept and wrote a bash based render queue!

 * 2023-01-29
   * Today was spent mostly cutting and rendering CongaDesk collages and adding small text edits to
     the KNOWER collage. I know at least one guy that has fun with it, and he got a conga.
   * Thanks to the hacked together rendering queue, my CPU cores almost continuously on render jobs.
   * This concludes the first week of this project. Now I will add some shorts and see how things
     develop. Are there enough people out there that are interest in this? Do I get some contact to
     jam with somebody or other opportunities? We will see and it was fun and worth a try.
   * The next few month I will concentrate on my work that will mostly involve programming. However
     I need to play my conga anyway, so I will probably record a few takes

 * 2023-02-01
   I luckily got some honest opinion from NPR legal and removed all content from youtube. I am very
   thankful for that honesty, because I would have sank more time into this (and Tiny Desk is still
   awesome, no worries). I think the whole media landscape is just too comercialized, that anything
   like my naive ideas could work. We cannot not have nice things, otherwise anybody could have fun.
   To clarify they just indicated that npr would not grant resticted rights to tiny desk videos for
   hobby musicians collages unless the artist and publisher would lobby hard for that to happen.
   That however tells me there is no chance to anything I envision (provide a legal fence around
   some works that can be dubbed by the hobby musicians that is), if even a contact at a nationally
   funded public media outlet would not really think anyone would consider such a project.
   I am really sad, but had fun learning recording and video editing for that project and was
   encouraged by the viewers. I hope someone, somewhere was surprise what sounds you get out of a
   drum. Thanks for all the fish!
