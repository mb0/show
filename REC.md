Recordings
==========

 * 2023-01-22 [Self Help - Cape Cassandra](https://soundcloud.com/djselfhelp/dj-self-help-cape-cassandra)
   First recording after some setup tests. I tried one song and only one take, that was not great.
   I need to find good equalizer, compressor, limiter setup and save that as presets. And this is
   the first session that I want to mix with the video.
   I could sync the video and audio using [Flowblade](https://jliljebl.github.io/flowblade/) and
   also not use a portrait aspect ration (same with [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)). But
   luckily Ardour can be used to sync video and audio. I ended up using Blender to convert the
   result, and plan to try to use it for a/v sync next time.

 * 2023-01-23 I have finally adjusted the input latency of my microphones and have saved yesterdays
   ardour plugin stacks as templates. Today I will run the android scrcpy on a laptop next to the
   camera, luckily I just bought a new mouse to remote control the laptop to remote control the
   smart phone.
   I decided that using only one and the first take is a great theme for this show. Yesterdays
   recordings had some poor taps here and there, some are artefacts of the equalizer raising a ghost
   tap to a audible one, but it was ok for the first take. Todays recordings:
