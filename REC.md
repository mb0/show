Recordings
==========

 * 2023-01-22 [Self Help - Cape Cassandra](https://soundcloud.com/djselfhelp/dj-self-help-cape-cassandra)
   First recording after some setup tests. I tried one song and only one take, that was not great.
   I need to find good equalizer, compressor, limiter setup and save that as presets. And this is
   the first session that I want to mix with the video.
   I could sync the video and audio using [Flowblade](https://jliljebl.github.io/flowblade/) and
   also not use a portrait aspect ration (same with [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)). But
   luckily Ardour can be used to sync video and audio. I ended up using Blender to convert the
   result, and plan to try to use it for a/v sync next time.
