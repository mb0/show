Recordings
==========

 * 2023-01-22 [Self Help - Cape Cassandra](https://soundcloud.com/djselfhelp/dj-self-help-cape-cassandra)
   First recording after some setup tests. I tried one song and only one take, that was not great.
   I need to find good equalizer, compressor, limiter setup and save that as presets. And this is
   the first session that I want to mix with the video.
   I could sync the video and audio using [Flowblade](https://jliljebl.github.io/flowblade/) and
   also not use a portrait aspect ration (same with [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)). But
   luckily Ardour can be used to sync video and audio. I ended up using Blender to convert the
   result, and plan to try to use it for a/v sync next time.

 * 2023-01-23 I have finally adjusted the input latency of my microphones and have saved yesterdays
   ardour plugin stacks as templates. Today I will run the android scrcpy on a laptop next to the
   camera, luckily I just bought a new mouse to remote control the laptop to remote control the
   smart phone.
   I decided that using only one and the first take is a great theme for this show. Yesterdays
   recordings had some poor taps here and there, some are artefacts of the equalizer raising a ghost
   tap to a audible one, but it was ok for the first take. Todays recordings:

   * [Tera Kora - The Legend Of Kora Book Two](https://soundcloud.com/tera-kora/the-legend-of-kora-remixes-edits-book-two)
   * That concludes the second day of recording. I only did one second take for the 4Hero-Jazzanova
     remix. Ardour crashed on me after the 30min Cid Rim recording, but the files were still there,
     so everything worked out fine. I adjusted the plugins and saved presets and templates.
   * I am not sure if I do the video sync and editing todayâ€¦ I am not yet satisfied with the
     recording quality. I want some noise reduction plugin and some filter path. I want the sound
     especially the resonances to be more open, the taps and kicks should be cleaner. I should
     probably wait to meet my best friend, who does that professionally.
   * Reviewing the video recordings, I noticed the smart phone has a better de-noise pass and that
     the camera stabilization seems to follow my body movement and crop the view area for headroom.
   * Total audio dubbed with video recordings today: 2:35:25; second takes: 1 :D
